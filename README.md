## Description

This short quiz allows the user to test their knowledge on a variety of coding material.

The app uses HTML, CSS and Javascript to allow the user to work through the questions while being timed. The user can save their highscore to measure if they are improving. 


## Installation

Follow the link to the deployed site. Read the instructions and press the 'start quiz' button to begin. The timer will start. A question will appear with 4 choices, if you get the answer wrong, 15 seconds will be deducted from your time and you'll move to the next question. If you get the answer correct, you will move you to the next question with no penalisation. Once all the questions have been answered or the timer reaches zero, the game will end. You can save your score with your initials and submit it to the highscores page. Highscores can be seen by selecting 'View Highscores' at the top of the page.
